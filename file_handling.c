/**
 * C FILE HANDLING - C can handle files in two ways
 * 1 - Stream orinted data - Data is stored in the same manner as it appears on the screen.
 * 2 - System orinted data / binary files - Data files are more closely associated with the OS

/**
 * STEPS FOR PROCESSING A FILE:-

 * 2 - open a file using the fopen() function
 * 3 - process a file using the suitable function
